Hashing
=======

Hashing Scripts using available methods in python Hashlib
***Exploring GIT Hub***
Intention is to ultimately come up with a ready to use hashing library that provides all the hashing methhods 
available and can be used based on the context (eg. for security centric usage use SHA512 or similar and for 
non security centric requirements use something like MD5 or SHA1)
Very early stages...ideas of Structuring this welcome :)
